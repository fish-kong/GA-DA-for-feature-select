# GA-DA-for-feature-select
In the Python environment, the genetic algorithm and the dragonfly algorithm are first combined to form a modified dragonfly genetic algorithm, and the effectiveness of the improved method is verified by using the test function. Secondly, the improved algorithm and decision tree are applied to feature selection (classification task) to remove redundant features from the original features
python环境下，首先结合遗传算法与蜻蜓算法形成改成的蜻蜓遗传算法，并利用测试函数验证了改进方法的有效性。其次将改进后的算法结合决策树应用于特征选择（分类任务），用于剔除原始特征中的冗余特征
